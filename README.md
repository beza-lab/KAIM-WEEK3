This summarizes the key findings from the exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted on the provided dataset. The EDA included data summarization, quality assessment, univariate and bivariate analysis, data comparison across geographical regions, outlier detection, and the creation of insightful visualizations. 

Data Summarization:
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate the variability for numerical features such as TotalPremium, TotalClaim

Data Structure: Review the dtype of each column to confirm if categorical variables, dates, etc. are properly formatted.

Data Quality Assessment: Check for missing values.

Univariate Analysis:
Distribution of Variables: Plot histograms for numerical columns and bar charts for categorical columns to understand distributions..

Bivariate or Multivariate Analysis:
Correlations and Associations: Explore relationships between the monthly changes TotalPremium and TotalClaims as a function of ZipCode, using scatter plots and correlation matrices.

Data Comparison
Trends Over Geography: Compare the change in insurance cover type, premium, auto make, etc. 

Outlier Detection:
Used box plots to detect outliers in numerical data

Visualization
develop plots that capture the key insight gained from EDA

Task 2

install and configure dvc 

Task 3
